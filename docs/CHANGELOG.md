## Change History

- **[2025/09]** Released [v0.9.0](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale/tree/release/v0.9.0):

  - Training & Finetuning: Added LoRA for efficient finetuning, improved the autotuner for cross-chip heterogeneous training,
    and enabled distributed RWKV training.
  - Inference & Serving: Introduced DiffusionEngine for FLUX.1-dev, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.1-T2V,
    support multi-model automatic orchestration and dynamic scaling.
  - Embodied AI: Full lifecycle support for Robobrain, Robotics, and PI0, plus semantic retrieval for MCP-based skills for RoboOS.
  - Elastic & Fault Tolerance: Detect task status automatically (errors, hangs, etc.) and periodically record them.
  - Hardware & System: Broader chip support, upgraded patch mechanism with file-level diffs, and enhanced CICD for different chips.

- **[2025/04]** Released [v0.8.0](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagScale/tree/release/v0.8.0):

  - Introduced a new flexible and robust multi-backend mechanism and updated vendor adaptation methods.
  - Enabled heterogeneous prefill-decoding disaggregation across vendor chips within a single instance via FlagCX (beta).
  - Upgraded DeepSeek-V3 pre-training with the new Megatron-LM and added heterogeneous pre-training
    across different chips for MoE models like DeepSeek-V3.
